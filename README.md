Record of data investigation, experimentation, and other thoughts are in my [Lab Notebook](doc/LAB-NOTEBOOK.md). All relevant Java source code is in [`src/main/java`](src/maing/java).

The project can be built with Gradle, specifically `gradle fatJar` will create a jar file that can be used with Spark. See my [Lab Notebook](doc/LAB-NOTEBOOK.md) for relevant `spark-submit` commands.
